#### OUMVLP
Since the huge differences between OUMVLP and CASIA-B, the network setting on OUMVLP is slightly different.
- In `./config.py`, modify `'batch_size': (8, 16)` into `'batch_size': (32,16)`.
- Prepare your OUMVLP dataset according to the instructions in [Dataset & Preparation](#dataset--preparation).
